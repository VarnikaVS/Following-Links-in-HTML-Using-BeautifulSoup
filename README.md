# Following-Links-in-HTML-Using-BeautifulSoup
The program will use urllib to read the HTML from the data files below, extract the href= vaues from the anchor tags, scan for a tag that is in a particular position relative to the first name in the list, follow that link and repeat the process a number of times and report the last name you find.


Actual problem: Start at: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/known_by_Ruben.html 
Find the link at position 18 (the first name is 1). Follow that link. Repeat this process 7 times. The answer is the last name that you retrieve.
